It requires python3, pip and virtualenv to exist on the host it is installed onto, then it loads itself into its own virtualenv.

Supported in MacOS and Linux.

For MacOS, get an updated python3:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo brew upgrade python3
{% endhighlight %}

And, make sure virtualenv exists:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo pip install virtualenv
{% endhighlight %}

Then install from the network (does not require super user privileges):

{% highlight bash %}
curl -sLO https://raw.github.com/reactorsc/reactor/master/.pkg/getreactor.sh &&\
	bash ./getreactor.sh
{% endhighlight %}
