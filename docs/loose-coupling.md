The principle of Loose Coupling in computing is extremely important to maintain a flexible infrastructure that can is easy to sustain.  This principle states that each component of a system has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components.  The purpose of this principle is in creating and sustaining large complex systems.  The less you couple with the definitions of different components, the easier it becomes to make individual changes without a cascading impact that becomes unmanageable.

In the container and server industry many systems hold an element of service management, but they are all tightly coupled with the rest of the solution.  Take any one of the container services available on the market.  Each works well with itself and may also include service definitions.  But as you layer in additional technologies, the complexity compounds.  If you need software delivery, or external traffic management, or any other number of reasons, the challenge is daunting.  This is because you are now binding tightly to each individual component, adding logarithmic levels of complexity.

By bringing a Reflex into the middle to be that pivot point for service management, it gives you flexibility to replace and iterate components.  You no longer need to figure out all pieces of the complex puzzle, you can work in steps and bring in pieces as they make sense.
