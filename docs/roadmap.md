Things in the labs but not yet released:

* <b>Reflex Hooks</b> -- callbacks based on changes and events to objects in Reflex Engine, using expressions similar to ABAC policies
* <b>Reflex Check</b> -- a container that can run within your infrastructure and do deep level version checks on sets of services (with full regex output)
* <b>Reflex UI</b> -- a front-end user interface

### Todo

Additional to complete:

* Tutoral on integrating a pipeline with release/flow control
