Things in the labs but not yet released:

<li> <b>Reflex Hooks</b> -- callbacks based on changes and events to objects in Reflex Engine, using expressions similar to ABAC policies
<li> <b>Reflex Check</b> -- a container that can run within your infrastructure and do deep level version checks on sets of services (with full regex output)
<li> <b>Reflex UI</b> -- a front-end user interface
