Designed around the concept of services for continuous software delivery in a containerized world, with ABAC for granular security.

Conventional configuration management systems focus on servers, and pivot around static assets. They struggle with continuous software delivery, management of secrets, and Infrastructure as Code.

Reflex centers itself around the concept of services, live configuration states delivered at run-time and ephemeral deployments in continuous delivery pipelines.

Reflex is not designed to be a software delivery system, nor is it designed to be a software build system. It is instead meant to fill in the gaps of the variety of existing systems, fixing many of the challenges faced as the industry evolves and improves.

It is designed with modern ABAC security concepts, and is meant to support secure run-time delivery of services, enhancing the solutions you already may have in place today to improve your options beyond what is possible with your current tools.
