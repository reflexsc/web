Reflex is Service Oriented, meaning it is focused on Services rather than Servers.  This is important for the new world of ephemeral systems.  Conventional Configuration management systems focus on servers, but in the world of containers, the server is no longer the asset we shold track.

Instead, Reflex pivots its data around Services, and the instances behind those services can be ephemeral or static.
