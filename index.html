<h2>Why?</h2>
</div>
<p>Conventional configuration management systems focus on servers, and pivot around static assets. These systems struggle with continuous software delivery, safe management of secrets, and Infrastructure as Code.
</p>

<p>Reflex centers itself around the concept of services, live configuration states delivered at run-time and ephemeral deployments in continuous delivery pipelines.
</p>

<p>Reflex is not designed to be a software delivery system, nor is it designed to be a software build system. It is instead meant to fill in the gaps of the variety of existing systems, fixing many of the challenges faced as the industry evolves and improves.
</p>

<p>It is designed with modern ABAC security concepts to address secrets in the emerging "Internet of Things" world, and is meant to support secure run-time delivery of services, enhancing the solutions you already may have in place today to improve your options beyond what is possible with your current tools.

<p>Reflex may not be for you if you are only interested in a handful of containers in a single environment (no tst/qa/stg/prd) and a few environment variables.  If you are wrestling with managing the sprawl of microservices, pipelines and coherency around both, or if the rabbit-breeding key-value secrets in vault/etcd are getting you down (or heaven forbid you are storing your secrets as plain environment variables), then Reflex may be of value.

<p>Reflex is Open Source Software, built by a community.
